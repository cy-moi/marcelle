# Contributing to Marcelle

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

## Get involved

There are many ways to contribute to Marcelle, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Simply start using Marcelle. Go through the [Getting Started](https://marcelle.dev/guide/getting-started.html) guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](#reporting-new-issues).
- Share your projects and writings, for example using the "Show and Tell" category on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/discussions).
- If you create new components, [share them as a third party library](#sharing-component-libraries) on npm
- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/issues). A good starting point would be issues tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels.
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](#your-first-pull-request).
- Read through our [documentation](https://marcelle.dev/). If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can make edits [in the repository](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/tree/master/docs).

Contributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/discussions) and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.

## Bugs

If you have questions about using Marcelle, please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/discussions) instead of opening an issue and we will do our best to answer your questions.

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/issues) for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. When [opening a new issue](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/issues/new/choose), always make sure to fill out the issue template.

- **One issue, one bug:** Please report a single bug per issue.
- **Provide reproduction steps:** List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

If you see anything you'd like to be implemented, create a [feature request issue](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

## Sharing Component Libraries

Marcelle can be extended with [custom components](https://marcelle.dev/guide/creating-components.html). While a few components are available within the core library, it is perfectly possible to share components or component libraries publicly. You can publish a package on NPM containaining ore of several components for others to reuse.

If you believe that a component belongs in the core library, feel free to open a pull request or a feature request issue.

## Pull requests

### Your first pull request

So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.

### Proposing a change

If you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can also file an issue with [feature template](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away, but we still recommend that you file an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

### Sending a pull request

Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle) and create your branch from `master`.
2. Describe your **test plan** in your pull request description. Make sure to test your changes.

All pull requests should be opened against the `master` branch.

### What happens next?

The core Svelte team will be monitoring for pull requests. Do help us by making your pull request easy to review by following the guidelines above.

## Style guide

Please configure your editor to use [Eslint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), for which configuration files are provided.
